## Deploying

The repository is already set up for deploy to kubernetes. 

From a fresh install, add a new file to the root of the project:

```

(Copy clear-values.yaml.example to get a head start)

Configure this file with your secret settings.

Run the following to generate a secret key and encrypt your settings.

```
npm run gen-secret-key
npm run encrypt-secrets
```

Set the following two secrets on your github repo:

Secret Name|Description

WERF_SECRET_KEY|The contents of .werf_secret_key in the root of your project
KUBE_CONFIG_BASE64_DATA|The output of `doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig show <config name> | base64` if using digital ocean
